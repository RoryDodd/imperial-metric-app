# Imperial/Metric App (Android - Java)

Go to the Master branch to see the code base.

This App I built due to the a planned trip to America.<br>
A quick and easy way for me to convert imperial measurments to metric on my phone as we travel.

Weather and currency conversion sections were added with API calls for up-to-date data on the go.<br>
The keys for the API calls have been removed from this code for obvious reason.
